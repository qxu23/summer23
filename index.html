	<h1><strong>Hello Shanghai :)</strong></h1>
	<h2>Welcome to Shanghai, one of China's largest cities, that blends the tradition culture with modernity!</h2>
	</header>
	<br>
	<p>Known as the "Paris of the East," Shanghai is a vibrant city that combines rich history and culture with modern charm. It is famous for its breathtaking cityscape, its famous skyline like the Shanghai Tower and Oriental Pearl TV Tower, coexists greatly with the historical sites like the Bund.
	Also, beyond its architectural marvels, Shanghai offers an exhilarating cultural experience. Traditional markets and neighborhoods, known as "nongtangs," contrast with busy commercial districts like Nanjing Road and people square, which is quite similar to the Times Square. Shanghai's unique blend of traditional and modern, East and West, creates a captivating atmosphere that is both dynamic and static. 
	It's a city that never sleeps, filled with endless opportunities for exploration and discovery.</p>
